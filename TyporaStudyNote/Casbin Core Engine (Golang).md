## Project

#### Project Name

**Casbin Core Engine (Golang)**

#### Project Description

https://github.com/casbin/SummerOfCode2022#casbin-core-engine-golang

#### Outline

- **Determine middleware type**

As described on the project description page: "Make a Casbin middleware for go-zero" firstly determines the middleware according to the characteristics of the project, and determines whether the project needs middleware that provides remote invocation type, or middleware of proxy and transaction monitoring type.

- **Read the source code and analyze it**

From what I understand, API performance largely depends on how the API responds to the different types of requests it receives.Some thoughts on this：Shrink and limit payload size ,  enable cache  or  Speed limiting and preventing malicious attacks.

- **Implement it in code**

Deep dive into projects and turn ideas into actual code

## **Expected Timeline**

| *Prior May 4*            | Familiarize yourself with the Casbin core engine. Consider whether there are other potential user preferences that warrant the introduction of this feature.Continue to dig deeper into Casbin's code by fixing issues. |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ***May 4 - 30***         | ***Analyze the source code and try to find the best solution.Discuss the implementation of the algorithm with the instructor. Study the classic algorithms we can refer to.*** |
| ***June 1 - 30***        | ***Implement the algorithm and test it. Write an evaluation document.*** |
| ***July 1 - August 14*** | ***Fix algorithm bugs.If the results of the algorithm implementation are not as good as expected, the algorithm should be improved.*** |
| ***August 14 - 29***     | ***Write a summary essay on the entire project.If I have more time to use, please try more algorithms.*** |

## Extra Information

***Reason for Participation***

***I have always wanted to be a great developer since the first day I learnt programming. GSoC provides me a chance to make contributions to open source projects with mentorship from great developers all over the world. I believe it is really amazing. If I have the chance to participate in GSoC and work with Casbin, I will try my best to complete this project.***

***By now, I'm familiar with the contribution workflow and how to collaborate with other developers and project maintainers***

***I am looking forward to working on the project with  Casbin!!!***
